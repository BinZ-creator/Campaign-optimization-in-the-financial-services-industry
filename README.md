price regression + products multi label classification

Introduction of the project
How to increase profits is the most important topic of every company. This report will 
show how a bank use machine learning methods to improve profit from direct marketing 
campaigns.
The problem is solved in two steps. The first step is to build regression models to predict 
the profit of each customer. The second step is to establish multi-label classification 
models to predict which of the 3 products each customer will buy.
